# LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-02
# Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM

This repository contains code and resources for predicting and forecasting stock market prices using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. The goal of this project is to build a model that can learn and predict stock prices based on historical data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical stock market prices for a particular stock (e.g., Apple, Google, etc.). The dataset includes features such as opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume. The dataset can be obtained from various financial data providers or APIs.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
https://github.com/rakshana-07/LGMVIP--DataScience-TASK-02/blob/main/Stock_Market_Prediction_and_Forecasting_using_stacked_LSTM.ipynb
```

2. Obtain the historical stock market data for the specific stock you want to predict and save it as a CSV file in the `data` directory.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository (`stock_prediction.ipynb`) to see the step-by-step process of loading the data, preprocessing it, building the Stacked LSTM model, training the model, and making predictions.

4. Alternatively, you can run the provided Python script (`stock_prediction.py`) using the command:

```bash
python stock_prediction.py
```

## Results

The notebook and script will output predictions for the stock's future prices based on the trained Stacked LSTM model. It's important to note that stock market prediction is a complex task and predictions may not always be accurate. This project serves as an educational example of using LSTM networks for time series forecasting.
